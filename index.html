    <p class="title">DBMS Terminology</p>

    <p class="heading">1. Data</p>
    <p class="text">Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts that are collected and stored by a computing machine. This can include numbers, text, images, or other forms of input that can be processed and analyzed to derive meaningful information.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">2. Information</p>
    <p class="text">Information is the result of processing data. It involves analyzing, contextualizing, structuring, and interpreting raw data to make it meaningful and useful. This transformation from data to information helps in decision-making and problem-solving.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">3. Metadata</p>
    <p class="text">Metadata is data about data. In a DBMS, it provides context and description for the actual data. Metadata includes information such as data type, data format, data source, and other attributes that help in understanding and managing the data effectively.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">4. Data Dictionary</p>
    <p class="text">A data dictionary is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements used or captured in a database, information system, or research project. It serves as a reference to understand the structure, relationships, and usage of data within a system.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">5. Database</p>
    <p class="text">A database is an organized collection of structured information, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management of data, supporting various operations such as querying, updating, and reporting.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">6. Table</p>
    <p class="text">A table is a set of data elements organized using a model of vertical columns and horizontal rows. Each column represents a specific attribute, and each row represents a single record or tuple in the table.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">7. Tuple(s)</p>
    <p class="text">A tuple is a single row or record in a database table. It represents a complete set of related data items, with each item corresponding to a column in the table.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">8. Field(s)</p>
    <p class="text">Fields in a database are individual pieces of data stored in a table. Each field typically represents a single attribute of a record, such as a name, date, or numeric value. Fields are also known as columns.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">9. Domain</p>
    <p class="text">A domain is the set of permissible values that a column can hold in a database table. It defines the data type and constraints for the values stored in that column, ensuring data integrity and consistency.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">10. Constraint(s)</p>
    <p class="text">Constraints in a DBMS are rules enforced on data columns to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and validity of the data. Common types of constraints include primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, not null constraints, and check constraints. These constraints help maintain data consistency and enforce business rules.</p>
    <hr>

    <p class="heading">11. Key(s)</p>
    <p class="text">Keys in a DBMS are attributes or sets of attributes that uniquely identify records in a table. Common types of keys include primary keys, which uniquely identify each record in a table; foreign keys, which establish relationships between tables; and candidate keys, which are potential primary keys.</p>
